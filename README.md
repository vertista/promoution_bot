ü§ñ Promotion Bot: A Telegram Assistant for Promotional Campaigns
This repository contains the source code for a multifunctional Telegram bot designed to automate the submission and review process for promotional campaigns and user-generated content (UGC) contests.

The bot serves as an admin assistant, simplifying routine tasks and ensuring smooth interaction with participants.

‚ú® Key Features
Submission Handling: The bot accepts video links from YouTube Shorts and TikTok, automatically filtering out invalid messages.

Automatic Stat Collection: Immediately after a link is submitted, the bot connects to the YouTube API or scrapes the TikTok page to fetch up-to-date statistics (views, likes, comments) and attaches them to the submission for the administrator.

Interactive Admin Workflow: All submissions are forwarded to the administrator's private messages with complete user info, the link, stats, and inline buttons "‚úÖ Approve" and "‚ùå Decline" for one-click decision-making.

Secure Payment Data Collection: The bot guides users through a conversation to collect and validate payment details (e.g., card number, crypto wallet), which are stored securely in a dedicated database.

Enhanced User Experience (UX): While a link is being processed, the user sees an animated loading message, providing clear feedback that their request is in progress.

Database Management: A protected /clear_db command is available exclusively for the administrator to completely wipe the user database of test or outdated entries.

24/7 Stability: The code includes a minimalist Flask web server to handle health checks from hosting platforms, preventing the bot from "sleeping" on free-tier plans.
